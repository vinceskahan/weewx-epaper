## WeatherFlow information

The original project this is based used the WeatherFlow API for readings and forecast.  This directory contains example files and other information related to using WeatherFlow rather than weeWX and the NWS for data.  While the code here does not (currently) use WeatherFlow for anything, the files here are for possible futures.
